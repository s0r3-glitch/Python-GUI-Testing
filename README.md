# Python-GUI-Testing
This project is an experiment with GUI's in Python in order to better understand how they work and what they are capable of.  

## Inspiration
When messing around with python years ago in my CIS-115 my professor when talking about the power of python brefly touched on how Python could do GUI's with Tkinter, but we never got around to actually doing anything with them other then drawing with turtle. So well at work I decided to mess around with TKinter and try and make a GUI with Tkinter. The idea behind this project is to do the following 4 things
- Config Editing
- Multi-Threading process/parallel processing
- pop up GUI's
- About button showing basic info about the pc and program

One thing id like to highlight is the multi-threading processes/parallel processing. Well this learning excersise is mainly about making GUI's with Tkinter I thought it would be a good idea to try and add support for multi-threading processes/parallel processing since in my mind the most common place you would use those is in GUI's so that things can happen in the background. I plan on making a dedicated learning excersise on multi-threading processes/parallel processing in the future but for now I am going to touch on it here. There is a good chance I dont figure out multi-threading processes/parallel processing in this excersise but it would be nice to try.
